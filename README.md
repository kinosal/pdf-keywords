# Analyze pdf files with keywords

Live version of this app at
https://share.streamlit.io/kinosal/pdf-keywords/main/app.py

## Description

This [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) mini-app counts the occurrences of
specific keywords (character sequences) in PDF files, e.g. to analyze how well
a candidate's CV fits the requirements for a job.

It uses the [pdftotext](https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext) package to extract
text from uploaded PDF files and visualizes a few statistics about the use of
specified keywords.

## Contribution

This app could easily be extended with new functionalities like pasting text
directly, scraping web pages like LinkedIn for content or comparing keywords
from two or more different text corpora.

you might have.
